    <h2 id="section1">General Information</h2>
    <p>Bins are collected EARLY on Monday mornings.  We put the bins out on Sunday night.  The alternations of the bins are:<br>18th Jan - GREEN BIN<br>25th Jan - YELLOW<br>1st Feb - GREEN<br>11th Feb - YELLOW<br>Please there is NO NEED to mow the yard as that is going above and beyond and will cut into important golf playing time<br>Pool is cleaned by a company on or about the 17th of each month.  They take care of everything however the pool may need topping up with water every now and then.  Usually fill to two tiles from the top is sufficient.<br>The pool is heated automatically and should not need any adjusting.<br>The outdoor area has an automatic shutting roof when rain is falling it wwill close.  You can adjust it with the remote next to the door.  Select zone 1 or 2, open and close as desired.<br>Plants we usually give a water each afternoon.  Dont worry about the planters on the side near the ktichen as they felt the wrath of Stella and she pulled them out - there is literally zero left to water...  The chillis are very edible - however warning are hot.  Thyme and oregano in the vegie pod are also free for use.</p><hr>

    <p>OK.  Both will sleep in the laundry in their bed at night.  They will try and slink into bed, however with encouragement and some carrying for Stella - they will go into the laundry at night when everyone is going to bed.<br>They are you constant companions whilst at home.  They will always want to be with or somewhere near you.  General rule is if you cant see them, they are up to something naughty.</p>
