    <h2 id="section1">General Information</h2>
    <p>Bins are collected EARLY on Monday mornings.  We put the bins out on Sunday night.  The alternations of the bins are:<br>18th Jan - GREEN BIN<br>25th Jan - YELLOW BIN<br>1st Feb - GREEN BIN <br>11th Feb - YELLOW BIN<br><br>Please there is NO NEED to mow the yard as that is going above and beyond and will cut into important golf playing time.<br><br>Pool is cleaned by a organised company on or about the 17th of each month.  They take care of everything however the pool may need topping up with water every now and then.  Usually fill to two tiles from the top is sufficient.<br>The pool is heated automatically and should not need any adjusting.<br><br>Pool umbrella - basically slide up and crank the handle to unferl and reverse to bring down.<br><br>The outdoor area has an automatic shutting roof when rain is falling it will close.  You can adjust it with the remote next to the door.  Select zone 1 or 2, open and close as desired.<br>Plants we usually give a water each afternoon.  Dont worry about the planters on the side near the ktichen as they felt the wrath of Stella and she pulled them out - there is literally zero left to water...  The chillis are very edible - however warning are hot.  Thyme and oregano in the vegie pod are also free for use.<br><br>BBQ is all good to go if you wish to use.  The gas bottle should be running out shortly as it has been going for far to long in my opinion - there is a spare full bottle in the garage should you need to swap it out.</p><hr>
<h2 id="section7">WiFi / TVs</h2>
    <p>WIFi SSID: Thebubble2.0 <br>Password: ThisGuy001 <br><br>There are 4 WiFi networks however they all share the same password.  Downstairs either use Thebubble2.0 or Thebubble2.0-5G.  In the main bedroom there is a WiFi extender same SSID simply with _EXT after the name.<br><br>Both TV's have Apple TV and most of the better streaming services all loaded on Apple TV should you wish to binge a few TV shows.  Sound bars should automatically fire up once you turn the TV on.</p><hr>
    <h2 id="section2">Walter and Stella</h2>
    <p>OK.  Both will sleep in the laundry in their bed at night.  They will try and slink into bed, however with encouragement and some carrying for Stella - they will go into the laundry at night when everyone is going to bed.<br><br>They are you constant companions whilst at home.  They will always want to be with or somewhere near you.  General rule is if you cant see them, they are up to something naughty.<br><br>Both are healthy and will usually sleep for most of the day - Stella is always on watch though and will bark (mainly at the neighbours). <br><br>Their vet (if required) is at the end of the Street. Phone number is on the fridge.<br><br>They can be a bit fussy with eating so if they turn their nose up at eating at all, there is nothing to worry about to any great deal, they will eat when hungry.  They are a once a day affair with food, usually around 6pm or so when we are cooking our own dinner.<br><br>They are pretty big water guzzlers so their bowl needs filling daily.<br><br> Poop - they do love a good poo for their size...  Scooping implement is at the side of the house neat the pool filter. White smaller garbage bags under the sink I use for disposal...<br><br>They have some strange habits - you will understand when you see them in action.  They dont play well with others so if you want to take them for a walk - be on guard for them to have a crack at any other dogs.  Their leads and harnesses are in the garage haning up with the bikes.  The like to escape also if given an opportunity be on guard.  They have a ritual 'go nuts' period in the late afternoon where they will play fight and run stupid around the place.  Entertaining and brutal at the same time.  Wally can get the shits after a while and will put Stella in her place, they can sometimes get a little over enthusiastic which may require a smack on the bum to get them to snap out of their exuberance.  Whilst this reads like they are monsters - they are defenitely not and are very lovable.  Both are desexed so no litter being born on the bed.</p><hr>

    <h2 id="section3">Shopping / Eating Out</h2>
    <p>Everything is pretty close and handy.  <a href="https://www.brookside.com.au/">Brookside shops, Woolies, Coles, Aldi, Brook Hotel</a> and such about 1 minute drive to the right off Griffith Street. Turn left you will have Woolies and Coles at Everton Park.<br><br><a href="https://evertonplaza.com.au">Everton Plaza</a> has a fairly good range of restaurants if you wish to wander down that way.</p><hr>
    
     <h2 id="section4">Lights and CCTV</h2>
    <p>The lamps in the dining room and TV room upstairs and the two beside the main bed are automatic or can be swithed on (or off) with Google Home.  Consoles are in the kitchen and main bedroom.<br><br>There are arlo cameras at the front and rear - set to arm late at night and go off in the morning - however will rearm through the day 8-4.  Let us know if you want that switched off or you can tell google to disarm the cameras also if needed.  </p><hr>
     <h2 id="section5">Vacuum aka Ricki</h2>
    <p>Ricki as he is known, will automatically vacuum and mop the downstairs section of the house each Monday, Wednesday and Friday starting about 9 am.<br>He will need the door to the garage open on those days so he can get out and do his thing. The dirty water and clean water container will need to be emptied / filled after about 3 cycles (ie each week). When filling the clean water tank simply add some floor cleaner (in the laundry cupboard) to the water and drop back on the docking station.</p><hr>
     <h2 id="section6">Laundry / Kitchen</h2>
    <p>Fairly self explanitory - Washing liquid and powder all in the laundry - spares in the cupboard in the laundry if required.  The washing machine, if you simply turn on and press the 'Favourite' button then start that will be the best cycle.  Tumble dryer has a water tank that requires emptying every now and then.  It slides out top left of the machine.<br><br>Oven, set the left hand knob two steps to the left (fan forced) the pictures have worn off a little....then set your temp - rest is straight forward.<br><br>Dishwasher, tablets are under the sink with other bits and pieces, pare garbage bags and the like.  Set the dishwasher on P3 usually and again straight forward from there.<br><br>More coffee beans are stored in a container in a cupboard under the coffee machine.<br><br>The walk in pantry has spares of most consumerables in the kitchen should you need.  Also in this room is the wine fridge.  Should you feel the need, please feel free to have a bottle or two.</p>
